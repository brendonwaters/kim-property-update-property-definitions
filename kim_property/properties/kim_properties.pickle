This means that at the end of the minimization in general the positions are no longer equal to the values stored in this array. Instead the fractional coordinates in the unrelaxed configuration would have to be computed and then multiplied by the relaxed cell vectors to obain the final positions.

VEnthalpy of mixing per atom versus concentration for a random solid solution binary alloy of species A and B at constant pressure and temperature. The enthalpy of mixing per atom is defined as the enthalpy of the binary alloy less the enthalpies of each species in the same crystal structure normalized by the number of atoms. This property is defined for the case where at zero concentration the crystal consists entirely of A atoms, and at concentration one, the crystal is entirely of species B. At each concentration the potential energy of the binary alloy is minimized.

VEnthalpy of mixing per atom versus concentration for a random solid solution binary alloy of species A and B at constant volume and temperature. The enthalpy of mixing per atom is defined as the enthalpy of the binary alloy less the enthalpies of each species in the same crystal structure normalized by the number of atoms. This property is defined for the case where at zero concentration the crystal consists entirely of A atoms, and at concentration one, the crystal is entirely of species B. At each concentration the potential energy of the binary alloy is minimized.

p1897
VThe relaxed energy-per-area versus all possible slips lying in the (111) lattice plane defines the Gamma surface. Due to periodicity of the crystal lattice, it suffices to sample a grid of points that span  a*sqrt(6)/2 and a*sqrt(2)/2  along the [112] and [-110] directions, respectively. This is achieved through a sequence of rigid displacements applied to one part of an fcc crystal relative to another on the (111) plane on a grid defined by the [112] and [-110] directions at zero temperature and a specified pressure. Following each slip displacement, a relaxation of the atomic coordinates is performed in the direction perpendicular to the slip plane to arrive at the energy-per-area.

VThe minimal atomic separation in the bi-crystal. This parameter is necessary for characterizing the grain boundary, since when computing a grain boundary energy it is conventional to prevent situations where a pair of atoms are too close together by removing one of them.  (Note that in such cases all removed atoms must be taken from the same grain.)  In situations where the minimum atom separation is unknown (e.g., experimental data), use the perfect crystal nearest neighbor distance.

VA surface (free) energy of a cubic monoatomic crystal at a specified hydrostatic stress and temperature. If computed, this corresponds to the 'relaxed' surface energy found by performing an energy minimization.

VThe verification check category. There are three possibilities: `informational', `consistency', and `mandatory'. Informational verification checks provide useful information about the model that have no implications regarding its internal consistency. Consistency verification checks test for violations of internal consistency (e.g. the forces are not the negative gradient of the energy). Mandatory verification checks test for failures of a model to satisfy critical KIM API requirements or declared capabilities (such as supporting a specified species).

VEach verification check returns a grade indicating how well the test was passed.  The type of grade returned is defined by the vc-grade-basis. There are two options: `graded' and `passfail'. A `graded' verification check returns a letter grade `A', `B', `C', `D' or `F' (where `A' is best, and `F' indicated failure). A `passfail' verification check returns `P' for pass, or `F' for fail. In situations where the verification check could not be performed, a value of `N/A' (for not available) must be returned.
