The orientation of the lattice is such that the e_3 axis is perpendicular to the basal plane, and the e_2 axis passes through a vertex of the hexagon. (The classical and strain gradient elastic constants are the 2nd derivatives of the strain energy density with respect to the Lagrangian strain and the Lagrangian strain gradient respectively.)

VEnthalpy of mixing per atom versus concentration for a random solid solution binary alloy of species A and B at constant pressure and temperature. The enthalpy of mixing per atom is defined as the enthalpy of the binary alloy less the enthalpies of each species in the same crystal structure normalized by the number of atoms. This property is defined for the case where at zero concentration the crystal consists entirely of A atoms, and at concentration one, the crystal is entirely of species B. At each concentration the potential energy of the binary alloy is minimized.

p1810
VThe relaxed energy-per-area versus all possible slips lying in the (111) lattice plane defines the Gamma surface. Due to periodicity of the crystal lattice, it suffices to sample a grid of points that span  a*sqrt(6)/2 and a*sqrt(2)/2  along the [112] and [-110] directions, respectively. This is achieved through a sequence of rigid displacements applied to one part of an fcc crystal relative to another on the (111) plane on a grid defined by the [112] and [-110] directions at zero temperature and a specified pressure. Following each slip displacement, a relaxation of the atomic coordinates is performed in the direction perpendicular to the slip plane to arrive at the energy-per-area.

The species of the atom being removed should match the species of the (monoatomic) reservoir crystal.

The following sequence of structures is traversed by the curve: ideal crystal -> intrinsic stacking fault -> two-layer twin nucleus.

VThe verification check category. There are three possibilities: `informational', `consistency', and `mandatory'. Informational verification checks provide useful information about the model that have no implications regarding its internal consistency. Consistency verification checks test for violations of internal consistency (e.g. the forces are not the negative gradient of the energy). Mandatory verification checks test for failures of a model to satisfy critical KIM API requirements or declared capabilities (such as supporting a specified species).

A `graded' verification check returns a letter grade `A', `B', `C', `D' or `F' (where `A' is best, and `F' indicated failure). A `passfail' verification check returns `P' for pass, or `F' for fail.
